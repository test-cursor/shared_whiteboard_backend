# Ignore All Pycache Directories in Git (2025-04-22 17:43:44)

update it to ignore ALL pycaches

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the `.gitignore` file to ignore all `__pycache__` directories, regardless of their location in the project structure. Looking at your project layout, there are multiple `__pycache__` directories in various subdirectories, so we should use a pattern that matches all of them.

I'll edit the `.gitignore` file to use the correct pattern:

---

```diff
  .env
  .git/
- /__pycache__
+ **/__pycache__/
```

---

I've updated the `.gitignore` file to use `**/__pycache__/` which will:
- The `**` matches any number of directories at any depth
- `__pycache__/` matches the exact directory name
- The trailing `/` ensures we're matching directories only

This pattern will now ignore all Python cache directories throughout your project, including those in subdirectories. This is the recommended way to handle Python cache files in Git.
