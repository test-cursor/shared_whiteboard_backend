# Backend Development for Shared Whiteboard App (2025-04-22 17:08:39)

_**User**_

DO NOT START CODING

i want to make a crud backend within my current folder

the app i envision making is as follows

a shared whiteboard app (where state is stored in sqlite / redis)

users should connect to rooms via websockets, and the backend should also handle auth / other generic crud features

ask me more clarifying questions so we can get into it

WE ARE JUST WORKING ON TEH BACKEND RIGHT NOW. WE WILL USE PYTHON AND FASTAPI

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you plan out the backend for a shared whiteboard app using FastAPI and Python. Let me ask some clarifying questions to better understand the requirements:

1. **Database Choice & State Management**:
   - Would you prefer SQLite or Redis for the primary database? We could also use both - Redis for real-time state (like active cursors, ongoing drawings) and SQLite for persistent data.
   - Do you need to store the complete drawing history or just the final state of each whiteboard?

2. **Authentication Requirements**:
   - What type of authentication would you prefer? (JWT, session-based, OAuth, etc.)
   - Do you need user registration/login, or would you prefer a simpler system where users just enter a name to join a room?
   - Should users be able to create private rooms with specific access permissions?

3. **Whiteboard Features**:
   - What drawing features need to be supported? (e.g., free drawing, shapes, text, images)
   - Do you need to support different colors, brush sizes, or other drawing attributes?
   - Should there be an undo/redo functionality?
   - Do you need to support saving/loading different versions of the whiteboard?

4. **Room Management**:
   - How should rooms be created? (automatically when first user joins, or explicit creation)
   - Should there be a limit on the number of users per room?
   - Do you need any moderation features (e.g., room admin who can kick users)?

5. **Real-time Features**:
   - Besides the drawing itself, what other real-time features do you need? (e.g., cursor positions, user presence)
   - Do you need chat functionality within rooms?
   - Should users see who else is currently in the room?

6. **Data Persistence**:
   - How long should whiteboards be preserved?
   - Should users be able to export/import whiteboards?
   - Do you need any automatic backup functionality?

Once you provide these details, we can design an appropriate architecture and start implementing the backend. I'm thinking of a structure that would include:

- FastAPI for the REST API and WebSocket handling
- SQLAlchemy for database ORM
- Pydantic for data validation
- Authentication middleware
- WebSocket manager for real-time communication
- Background tasks for any cleanup/maintenance

Let me know your thoughts on these questions, and we can proceed with the implementation!

_**User**_

these are great questions!

sqlite will be the main database (persistent) while redis wil store real time state

jwt auth is preferred

just enter a name and join a room / make a room (join from an invite link)

no need for private rooms

just free drawing

users auto make a room, or join via an invite link

no limit on users

no moderatino

no chat, but cursor positions, and presense

whiteboards should be preserved indefinetely

yes, should be able to import / export (only import on room creation)

please auto backup

lets use sqlmodel insteaed of alchemy!

any more questions / clarifiation

---

_**Assistant**_

Thanks for the detailed answers! Let me summarize and ask a few final clarifying questions before we start implementing:

**Confirmed Understanding:**
1. **Database:**
   - SQLite for persistent storage (using SQLModel)
   - Redis for real-time state (cursors, presence, current drawing state)

2. **Authentication:**
   - JWT-based
   - Simple flow: Enter name → Get JWT → Join/Create room
   - Public rooms only

3. **Room Features:**
   - Rooms created automatically when first user joins
   - Join via invite link
   - No user limits or moderation
   - Real-time cursor positions and presence
   - No chat needed

4. **Drawing:**
   - Free drawing only
   - Persistent storage
   - Import/Export functionality
   - Auto-backup system

**Additional Clarifying Questions:**

1. **Drawing State:**
   - Should we store drawing data as vector paths (more scalable) or as bitmap data?
   - For the real-time sync, should we send each individual drawing action, or batch them for performance?

2. **Room Management:**
   - How should room cleanup work? Should empty rooms be automatically deleted after a certain period?
   - Should there be a way to list active/recent rooms, or only access via invite links?

3. **Backup System:**
   - How frequently should auto-backups occur?
   - Should we keep multiple backup versions or just the latest?

4. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Should we implement rate limiting for drawing actions to prevent spam/abuse?
   - Should we limit the number of rooms a single IP can create?

5. **Technical Preferences:**
   - Do you want to use async Redis (aioredis) or sync Redis?
   - Any preference for the WebSocket library (FastAPI's built-in websockets or Socket.IO)?
   - Should we use UUIDs or simple incremental IDs for room identifiers?

Once you answer these, we can start setting up the project structure and implementing the core functionality! I'm thinking of organizing the code with the following structure:

```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── websockets/
│   │   └── dependencies/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── config.py
│   │   ├── security.py
│   │   └── events.py
│   ├── models/
│   ├── schemas/
│   ├── services/
│   └── utils/
├── tests/
├── alembic/
└── docker/
```

Let me know if this structure looks good to you and if you have any preferences for the additional questions!

_**User**_

lets use vector paths. this will be higher quality

lets try and batch actions when we send for performance

empty rooms should be auto cleared after 5min

only access via invite link

auto backups every minute, in case of failures

no rate limiting

one ip can only create 10 rooms at once

async redis

fastapi built in

uuid for room identifiers yes

dont start coding yet. any more questions?

if not please put an updated prompt with all specifications in a file 'prompt.md'

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a comprehensive prompt.md file that documents all our specifications. Let me first check if I have any final clarifying questions:

1. **Vector Paths:**
   - Should we store any metadata with each path (timestamp, user who drew it, etc.)?
   - Should we support different stroke widths/colors for the vectors?

2. **Batching:**
   - What's the preferred batch interval for drawing actions (e.g., 100ms, 200ms)?
   - Should we have a maximum batch size?

3. **Error Handling:**
   - How should we handle reconnections? Should we sync the full state or just missing actions?
   - Should we implement any conflict resolution for simultaneous edits?

4. **Export/Import:**
   - What format should we use for export/import? (JSON, SVG, custom format?)
   - Should exports include room metadata or just the drawing data?

While you answer these, I'll create the prompt.md file with what we know so far:
