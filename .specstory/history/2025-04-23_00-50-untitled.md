why does git not ignore my whiteboard.db file?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you understand why `whiteboard.db` isn't being ignored by Git. First, I'll check if the file is already being tracked by Git, as that's a common reason why `.gitignore` rules might not take effect.

---

```bash
git ls-files whiteboard.db | cat
```

```
(venv) test-crud [main●●] % 

```

---

Let me also check the Git status to see how Git sees this file:

---

```bash
git status | cat
```

```
(venv) test-crud [main●●] % git status | cat
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

(venv) test-crud [main●●] %
```
