_**Assistant**_

Let me help you with this issue. The problem occurs because when you run `python3 app/main.py` directly, Python doesn't recognize the `app` package properly. This is a common issue with Python module imports.

There are two ways to fix this:

1. **Recommended Solution**: Use `uvicorn` to run your FastAPI application (this is the standard way to run FastAPI apps):
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This command:
- `app.main` refers to the module path
- `:app` refers to the FastAPI instance in your main.py
- `--reload` enables auto-reload during development

2. Alternative Solution: If you really need to run the Python file directly, you would need to modify your import statements to use absolute imports and add the project root to the Python path. However, this is not recommended for FastAPI applications.

I recommend going with the first solution using `uvicorn` since:
1. It's the standard way to run FastAPI applications
2. It provides proper ASGI server support
3. It handles reloading and other development features
4. It's already installed in your environment (I can see it in your `venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/`)

Try running the application with the `uvicorn` command and let me know if you still face any issues!
